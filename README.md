## Inspiration
As plant enthusiasts, we often struggle with providing the right amount of care for our plants. Sometimes we forget to water them, or we don't know when they need more sunlight. That's why we came up with the idea of the  Botanic Buddy, a device that helps monitor the health of our plants and alerts us when they need attention.

## What it does
The  Botanic Buddy is a hardware device that measures three key environmental factors that affect plant growth: moisture, temperature, and light. It uses sensors to detect the levels of each factor and displays them on an LCD screen. Additionally, it alerts us through a buzzer and DC motor when the moisture level drops below a certain threshold.

## How we built it
We built the Botanic Buddy using an Arduino Uno board, a moisture sensor, a temperature sensor, a light sensor, an LCD screen, a buzzer, and a DC motor. We wrote the code in C++ using the Arduino IDE.

## Challenges we ran into
Learned things from scratch.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of successfully building a device that can help us monitor and care for our plants. We also added the unique feature of using a DC motor to automatically turn off when the moisture level drops, which can help save water.

## What we learned
Through this project, we learned a lot about working with sensors and how to integrate various components into a single device. We also learned about the importance of calibrating sensors for accurate readings.

## What's next for Botanic Buddy
In the future, we plan to add connectivity to the device so that it can send notifications to our smartphones. We also want to explore the possibility of adding more sensors to measure additional factors that affect plant growth, such as air quality and humidity.
